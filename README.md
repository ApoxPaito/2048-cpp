A pretty straight forward game of 2048, written in C++ with OOP logic. You'll see that if you look at the Header files and what kind of functions I've implemented.

Compile it with either make, or just put the Header and Source files in a Visual Studio and build the project.

P.S. I recommend you to use MinGW if you want make for Windows, very useful.
